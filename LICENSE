LICENSE

This software is released under a GPL v3.0 with one addition: To use this code you must publicly admit that social goods (like the code for this game) are valuable even outside of capitalism.  That "human nature" allows people to do good things for reasons other than financial renumeration, and that the vast majority of arguments for capitalism arise directly out of a desire to justify human greediness.
