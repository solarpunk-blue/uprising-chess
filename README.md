Uprsigin Chess is a chess variant where the pawns unite to take down their Capitalist overlords.  Visit [uprisingchess.web.app](https://uprisingchess.web.app) to play.

## more info
The game is a project of [solarbunk.blue](https://solarpunk.blue), a speculative fiction, game, and education project by [Will Stedden](https:will.stedden.org) dedicated to imagining a more equitable and sustainable world. Read [this article]() for more details on the backstory behind Uprising Chess.

## code
The game code is based on Anuv Gupta's [chessroom](http://github.com/anuvgupta/chessroom.ml) and Gautam Bajaj's (Chess-AI)[https://github.com/gautambajaj/Chess-AI/].  Much thanks to both of them for the headstart on this project.  The code is released with a very special [license](/LICENSE) that requires anyone using this code to admit that capitalism is just a justification for human greediness and that common goods (like this code) have value even without financial renumeration. Enjoy :)
