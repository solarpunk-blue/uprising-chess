## code
The game code is based on Anuv Gupta's [chessroom](http://github.com/anuvgupta/chessroom.ml).  Much thanks to him for the headstart on this project.  The code is released with a very special [license](/LICENSE) that requires anyone using this code to have to admit that capitalism is only a justification for human greediness and that common goods (like this code) have value even without financial renumeration.
